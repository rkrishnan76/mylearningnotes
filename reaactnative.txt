Touchables
Users mainly interact with web apps with clicks. In the world of mobile apps, however, several different touch gestures are used to navigate through the app: tapping a button, swiping to scroll through a list, and so on.

React Native offers a number of components to handle "tapping gestures," or what is called Touchables. Let's take a look at them in detail in the following video:

Button
TouchableHighlight
TouchableOpacity

QUESTION 1 OF 3
What is true about handling touches in React Native apps? Select all that apply:

Both Buttons and Touchables have access to an onPress prop


Touchables can be nested within Views, and Views can be nested within Touchables

Lists
React Native comes with a few ways to render lists. 
You'll probably run into ScrollView and FlatList components most commonly, so let's take a look at both of these in detail!


TextInput
KeyboardAvoidingView
Slider
Switch

What is true about KeyboardAvoidingView? Select all that apply:

Without KeyboardAvoidingView, the keyboard will "pop up," hiding text inputs

KeyboardAvoidingView can wrap around TextInput components

Padding can be adjusted via a prop on KeyboardAvoidingView

source require for local image
source uri for remote image


Other Components
We've just seen some of the most important components built into React Native. These components will get you started with the essential functionalities in the apps that you build -- but the list of available components goes on! Feel free to review the React Native documentation for a complete list. For starters, we recommend checking out:

ActivityIndicator
Picker
WebView
Modal
Note that certain components are also platform-specific! Though you want to build cross-platform components with composition, reusing as much code as possible, it may make sense for certain elements to be different depending on your audience (i.e., iOS vs. Android).

Summary
React Native provides a variety of built-in components for developing mobile applications. While some support basic functionality in an application (e.g., text, images, lists), others offer more specialized functionality (e.g., pulling to refresh, displaying a loading indicator). Feel free to check out Components and APIs in the React Native documentation for an exhaustive list.

The React Native documentation on AsyncStorage mentions:

AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead of LocalStorage.

In the next video, we'll see just how we can implement it into our app!

React Native's version of localStorage is AsyncStorage. Conveniently, since AsyncStorage is just an abstraction over iOS and Android equivalents, there's no need to consider the different environments.

We took a close look at AsyncStorage's three main methods:

setItem
removeItem
clear

In the next section, we'll incorporate Redux to help manage application state!
